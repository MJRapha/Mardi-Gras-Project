        <h1 class="aboutheader">About Us</h1>
        <p class="aboutparagraph">The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in all of Louisiana, including the city of New
            Orleans. Celebrations are
            concentrated for about two weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day before Ash Wednesday (the start
            of lent in
            the Western Christian tradition). Usually there is one major parade each day (weather permitting); many days
            have
            several large parades. The largest and most elaborate parades take place the last five days of the Mardi
            Gras season. In
            the final week, many events occur throughout New Orleans and surrounding communities, including parades and
            balls (some
            of them masquerade balls).

            The parades in New Orleans are organized by social clubs known as krewes; most follow the same parade
            schedule and route
            each year. The earliest-established krewes were the Mistick Krewe of Comus, the earliest, Rex, the Knights
            of Momus and
            the Krewe of Proteus. Several modern "super krewes" are well known for holding large parades and events
            (often featuring
            celebrity guests), such as the Krewe of Endymion, the Krewe of Bacchus, as well as the Zulu Social Aid &
            Pleasure Club—a
            predominantly African American krewe. Float riders traditionally toss throws into the crowds. The most
            common throws are
            strings of colorful plastic beads, doubloons, decorated plastic "throw cups", Moon Pies, and small
            inexpensive toys.
            Major krewes follow the same parade schedule and route each year.

            While many tourists center their Carnival season activities on Bourbon Street, major parades originate in
            the Uptown and
            Mid-City districts and follow a route along St. Charles Avenue and Canal Street, on the upriver side of the
            French
            Quarter. Walking parades - most notably the Krewe du Vieux and Chewbacchus - also take place downtown in the
            Faubourg
            Marigny and French Quarter in the weekends preceding Mardi Gras Day. Mardi Gras Day traditionally concludes
            with the
            "Meeting of the Courts" between Rex and Comus.

        <p class="generalinfopara aboutparagraph">
            In 1979, the New Orleans police department went on strike. The official parades were canceled or moved to
            surrounding
            communities, such as Jefferson Parish, Louisiana. Significantly fewer tourists than usual came to the city.
            Masking,
            costuming, and celebrations continued anyway, with National Guard troops maintaining order. Guardsmen
            prevented crimes
            against persons or property but made no attempt to enforce laws regulating morality or drug use; for these
            reasons, some
            in the French Quarter bohemian community recall 1979 as the city's best Mardi Gras ever.

            In 1991, the New Orleans City Council passed an ordinance that required social organizations, including
            Mardi Gras
            Krewes, to certify publicly that they did not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, gender or sexual
            orientation,
            to obtain parade permits and other public licenses. Shortly after the law was passed, the city demanded
            that these
            krewes provide them with membership lists, contrary to the long-standing traditions of secrecy and the
            distinctly
            private nature of these groups. In protest—and because the city claimed the parade gave it jurisdiction to
            demand
            otherwise-private membership lists—the 19th-century krewes Comus and Momus stopped parading. Proteus did
            parade in
            the 1992 Carnival season but also suspended its parade for a time, returning to the parade schedule in 2000.

            Several organizations brought suit against the city, challenging the law as unconstitutional. Two federal
            courts later
            declared that the ordinance was an unconstitutional infringement on First Amendment rights of free
            association, and an
            unwarranted intrusion on the privacy of the groups subject to the ordinance. The US Supreme Court
            refused to hear
            the city's appeal from this decision.

            Today, New Orleans krewes operate under a business structure; membership is open to anyone who pays dues,
            and any member
            can have a place on a parade float.

        <h1 class="aboutheader">Traditional colors</h1>
        <img src="images2/220px-Flag_of_Rex_(Mardi_Gras_colors).svg.png" alt="">
        <p class="aboutparagraph">The colors traditionally associated with Mardi Gras in New Orleans are purple, green,
            and gold. The colors were first
            specified in proclamations by the Rex organization during the lead-up to their inaugural parade in 1872,
            suggesting that
            balconies be draped in banners of these colors. It is unknown why these specific colors were chosen; some
            accounts
            suggest that they were initially selected solely on their aesthetic appeal, as opposed to any true
            symbolism.

            Errol Laborde, author of Marched the Day God: A History of the Rex Organization, presented a theory that the
            colors were
            based on heraldry: all three colors correspond to a heraldic tincture, and Rex's goal may have been to
            create a tricolor
            to represent their "kingdom". Purple was widely associated with royalty, while white was already heavily
            used on other
            national flags, and was thus avoided. Furthermore, he noted that a flag in green, gold and purple in that
            order complies
            with the rule of tincture, which states that metals (gold or silver) can only be placed on or next to other
            colors, and
            that colors cannot be placed on or next to other colors.

            Following a color-themed Rex parade in 1892 that featured purple, green, and gold-colored floats themed
            around the
            concepts, the Rex organization retroactively declared that the three colors in that order symbolized
            justice, power, and
            faith. The traditional colors are commonly addressed as purple, green, and gold, in that order—even though
            this order
            technically violates the rule of tincture.

            LaToya Cantrell (née Wilder; born April 3, 1972) is an American politician serving as the Mayor of New
            Orleans,
            Louisiana since May 7, 2018. A Democrat, Cantrell is the first woman to hold the office. Before becoming
            mayor, Cantrell
            represented District B on the New Orleans City Council from 2012–2018.

        <h1 class="aboutheader">Mayor of New Orleans</h1>
        <p class="aboutparagraph">Cantrell was inaugurated as mayor on May 7, 2018, the first woman to hold the position
            in the city's history. Once
            in office, she established a new Office of Youth and Families, with the goal of creating a strategic plan to
            address
            families in crisis in the city. Cantrell also founded a Gun Violence Reduction Council, tasked with finding
            solutions to
            violent crime. Starting with a push to rededicate hotel taxes collected within the city for city use,
            Cantrell has
            focused on her #fairshare initiative to improve city infrastructure, public transportation, public parks,
            and green
            spaces. As part of that initiative, in October 2018 the City of New Orleans filed a lawsuit against four
            opioid
            manufacturers and distributors.

            During the 2019 session of the Louisiana Legislature, Cantrell negotiated the Fair Share Agreement with
            Governor John
            Bel Edwards and city, state, and tourism officials. The agreement secured $50 million in upfront funding for
            the city's
            infrastructure needs as well as $26 million in annual recurring revenue for the city. Following the approval
            of the
            Fair Share Agreement, New Orleans voters approved 3 of the 4 proposals Cantrell and the City Council put on
            the ballot
            in the 2019 general election. Voters approved a $500 million bond sale and a tax on short-term rental
            properties, as
            well the establishment of a Human Right Commission under the New Orleans Home Rule Charter.

        <h1 class="aboutheader">Awards</h1>
        <p class="aboutparagraph">In 2016, Cantrell was given a lifetime achievement award by the presidents of Tulane,
            Loyola and Xavier universities and
            the University of New Orleans for her service to the community.

        <h1 class="aboutheader">2021 mayoral election</h1>
        <p class="aboutparagraph">Cantrell was re-elected to office by a wide margin in November 2021, securing 65% of
            the vote. Her campaign focused
            on the city's status in 2020 as a COVID-19 hotspot and her efforts, which at times were unpopular, to stop
            the disease's
            spread. She also stressed the need for higher-paying jobs for city workers, better public health outcomes
            and new
            technologies for the future of New Orleans.
