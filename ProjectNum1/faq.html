                        <strong>No!</strong> Mardi Gras is a holiday, just like Christmas and Easter. It belongs to
                        everyone.
                        Do not believe the claims of businesses who offer "official" Mardi Gras merchandise or an
                        "official" Mardi Gras website. Using the term “official” is just a way for vendors to sell their
                        products or services to those who do not know better. Products or websites are not licensed by
                        the government for Mardi Gras. Each individual parade krewe is responsible for all of its
                        merchandise.
                        In some parts of the country, official organizations control their Mardi Gras celebration, but
                        this is not true in New Orleans.

                        Mardi Gras day (Fat Tuesday), however, is on a different day each year.

                        Fat Tuesday changes every year because Easter Sunday is never on the same Sunday each year. Fat
                        Tuesday is always the day before Ash Wednesday.

                        Most visitors plan to arrive no later than the Saturday prior to Mardi Gras day and stay through
                        Ash Wednesday.

                        Sometimes it will change from one extreme to the other during the same day. It’s a good idea to
                        layer your clothes since a chilly morning may turn into a warm afternoon.

                        Since you will be spending long days outside, pack comfortable shoes and clothes that can get
                        somewhat dirty. Don’t forget to check the forecast for rain. If storms are predicted, then
                        you’ll definitely want to bring a raincoat!

                        down the streets of New Orleans.
                        The streets are packed all day Saturday and Sunday with parade watchers. If you can stay longer
                        than a weekend, Monday (Lundi Gras) and Fat Tuesday are also great days to experience Mardi
                        Gras. Orpheus, another big parade, rolls on that Monday night, and the Zulu Lundi Gras festival
                        goes on all day. On Fat Tuesday, walking around the French Quarter and seeing all of the
                        costumes and masks is a unique and thrilling experience.

                        Even though every parade is unique, Orpheus, Bacchus, and Endymion feature the most
                        intricate, massive, and extravagant
                        floats.

                        According to Wikipedia, “While there is no official definition for "super Krewe,” it is
                        generally accepted that a super krewe possesses over 1,000 active dues-paying members and
                        maintains at least 500 riders for its parade each carnival.”
                        Here at MardiGrasNewOrleans.com, we think there’s a little more to it than that.

                        Along with a large membership, super krewes have huge, double- and triple-decker floats, much
                        sought-after signature throws, and celebrity monarchs. They also are known for their big before
                        and after-parade celebrations with big-name talent.

                        The first super krewe was Bacchus, founded in 1968. While founded in 1967, Endymion emerged as a
                        super krewe in 1974.
                        Orpheus, founded in 1993, also enjoys super krewe status. Three all-female super krewes also
                        take to the parade route, including the Krewe of Muses and the Krewe of Nyx. With 1,600+ active
                        riders, the Krewe of Iris, established in 1917, is not only the largest female Mardi Gras krewe,
                        but it is also the oldest.
